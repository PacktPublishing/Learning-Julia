# Learning Julia
This is the code repository for [Learning Julia](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-julia?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785883279), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Julia is a highly appropriate language for scientific computing, but it comes with all the required capabilities of a general-purpose language. It allows us to achieve C/Fortran-like performance while maintaining the concise syntax of a scripting language such as Python. It is perfect for building high-performance and concurrent applications. From the basics of its syntax to learning built-in object types, this book covers it all.

This book shows you how to write effective functions, reduce code redundancies, and improve code reuse. It will be helpful for new programmers who are starting out with Julia to explore its wide and ever-growing package ecosystem and also for experienced developers/statisticians/data scientists who want to add Julia to their skill-set.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
F(Stat_0) = Stat_n(Stat_n-1(...(Stat_1(Stat_0)))) = Stat_n
```

To execute the instructions and code in this book, you need to have a system with Julia installed on it. 

Detailed steps are given at the relevant instances in the book.
